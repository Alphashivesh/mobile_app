## ðŸ“– About The Project

This application serves as a comprehensive platform for users to find and request services from various vendors. It features a dynamic home screen that lists all available service categories, a user registration and login system, and a unique, detailed request form for each category. The project is built with a modern tech stack, featuring a cross-platform Flutter application for the frontend and a robust Node.js REST API for the backend, all connected to a MySQL database.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

-   *Frontend:* Flutter (Dart)
-   *Backend:* Node.js, Express.js
-   *Database:* MySQL
-   *Security:* bcrypt for password hashing

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
* Node.js ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
* Flutter SDK ([Installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
* A MySQL server (like XAMPP, WAMP, or a standalone instance)

### Database Setup

1.  Ensure your MySQL server is running.
2.  Using a database management tool (like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or phpMyAdmin), run the setup.sql script provided in the project. This will create the app database and all the necessary tables.

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    bash
    cd backend
    
2.  Install the required NPM packages:
    bash
    npm install
    
3.  Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your database credentials:
    env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=app
    
4.  Start the server:
    bash
    npm run dev
    
    The API server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the frontend_app directory:
    bash
    cd frontend_app
    
2.  Get the Flutter packages:
    bash
    flutter pub get
    
3.  *Crucial Step:* Open the lib/services/api_service.dart file. Find the _baseUrl variable and replace the placeholder IP address with your computer's actual local IP address (which you can find by running ipconfig on Windows or ifconfig on macOS/Linux).
    dart
    // Example
    static const String _baseUrl = '[http://192.168.1.10:3000/api](http://192.168.1.10:3000/api)';
    
4.  Run the app on your connected device or emulator:
    bash
    flutter run
